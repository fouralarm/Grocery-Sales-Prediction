# Grocery-Sales-Prediction
A code that utilizes data from a grocery chain, performs EDA and then compares the following regression models:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Extra Trees Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boost Regressor
LGBM Regressor

The idea is that upon entering prior-known information such as the City (of the store), the item number, whether it will be on promotion or not, whether that time will be a holiday or not, a store owner can predict the sales of a particular item and hence accordingly stock it.
